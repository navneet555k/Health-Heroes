<h3>Why are we building this application?</h3>
<p>Handling medical files and prescriptions has always been a pain, moreover, in the age of social distancing, it makes complete sense to switch to a digital medium for handling medical paperwork. Keeping that in mind, we have designed a solution to completely eradicate the physical aspect of handling medical paperwork by the use of a specialized mobile app, which keeps track of your files and prescriptions.</p>

### Workflow of Our Application:-

<h3> Steps for using</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repo</li>
  <li>Open Android Studio</li>
  <li>Open Project</li>
  <li>Go to the location where you have saved the project</li>
  <li>Go to the java folder where you can see all the java files.That is the main project</li>
  <li>Connect to emulator or mobile through USB to use the app after running  successfully</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources and Languages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>XML for UI</li>
  <li>Firebase for storing user data(Details about Firebase given below)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Firebase By Google</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Firebase is Google's mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps and grow your business.Firebase basically makes backend easy for you.Our app relies heavily on it and we are thankful about it.</li>
    <li>What is best about firebase is that it is actually free. Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service — BaaS — and grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. It uses Google Cloud Platform which we couldn't use exactly cause we didn't had money so we turned to Firebase which is a very good alternative and we absolutely loved using it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Notes :notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This app uses Firebase so if you clone this app all the data you enter would get stored in our database. So make sure to register your own app on Firebase in order see the data stored</li>
  <li><a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1">Visit the Firebase site for more knowledge on this</a></li>
  <li>If you get compatibility issues go to android folder, right click and click on migrate and then migrate project to Android X.</li>
</ul>
